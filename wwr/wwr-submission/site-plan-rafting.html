    <img src="../../images/Water.jepg" alt=""rivers" style="width: 300px; height: 300px" /> 
    <p class=""colored">
    We have a lot of rivers that we want to take you down. The river here is known for its water vipers that love to ride down the rapids with you. We also are always looking 
    for experienced rafters who don't have a problem with encountering 20-foot alligators. If those sound too intense, we always can take you down Sissie lake. 

     <h5>Rivers</h5> 
    <img src="../../images/Rocks.jpeg" alt=""rivers" style="width: 300px; height: 300px" /> 
    <p class=""colored">
    We also have great mountains and cliffsides that you can climb. If you want to test your strength on both water and on land, then take one of our rafting trips to 
    the Nightmare mountain.
